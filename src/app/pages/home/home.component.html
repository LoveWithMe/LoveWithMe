                <p>Diamond Jenkins completed her training as a domestic violence facilitator for Advanced Behavioral
                    Rehabilitation and I was able to watch as she conducted her first couple of classes. I worked with
                    Ms.
                    Jenkins for a few weeks and also took over a few of her classes many months later when she needed a
                    substitute to teach the class and her clients from her group gave their unsolicited reviews of how
                    much
                    they were learning from her class. From the beginning Ms. Jenkins was motivated to do a great job
                    and
                    had plenty of ideas on how to gain the groups attention to keep them involved in the course
                    material.
                    She came with a great deal of knowledge on how to teach a domestic violence class and presented new
                    material in a way that captured their attention. She was always able to manage the group and
                    provided
                    positive feedback as they were learning new skills. In summary, Diamond was truly a great coworker
                    and I
                    am grateful that I had the pleasure to work and learn from her.</p>

                <p>Diamond is truly a Diamond! Her holistic and straightforward approach to healing is phenomenal. I

                    worked side by side with Diamond for over 10 years. I have worked with her in stressful and
                    complicated
                    situations that required high levels of empathy and understanding for which she met every one with
